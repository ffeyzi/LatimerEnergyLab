# LatimerEnergyLab

In case you're wondering what this project is!: 

This website was created in order to briefly introduce and showcase what the Latimer Scholars did this year. I created the website on the side, while working with the other team members on the research projects on hand. A lot of times, we had to wait for parts to come in to resume our testing, and it was during those times this one page site was put together. 

A little bit about the site:

This one-page responsive site was all made in HTML/CSS. No JavaScript/JQuery was used in order to make this. I initially was thinking about including a web slider/carousel, but decided against it. This is the third website I've created overall. Overall, I think the project came together pretty well. There are definitely some things that can be worked on in the future -such as there is quite a bit of repetitive code in both the HTML and CSS documents, but for the purpose this was being created, I think everything is solid.  I like the color scheme that I used for the site (and for anyone wondering where to find some solid color schemes, I'd recommend flatuicolors.co . 

That's about it!
